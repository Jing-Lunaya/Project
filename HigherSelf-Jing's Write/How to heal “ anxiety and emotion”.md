# How to heal “ anxiety and emotion”

How to heal “ anxiety and emotion”
Onlookers clear, I actually saw this many times
And I tried to make him realize it serval times in many ways.
Such as stimulating him with the same emotional emotions, which turned out to be counterproductive
In short, when he was at the highest point of emotion at the time of this kind of thing, I also expressed an excited expression with him to remind him to pay attention, but stimulated his stronger emotional rebound.

Today I repeatedly asked him to pay attention to this situation, but just remember to let go and let's talk tomorrow.
Every time he said he was reluctant to express his difficulties,
In the end, I said that I am not holding you accountable, or that you have done wrong. He was considered settled, with the kind of aggrieved when he was reprimanded by his parents.

Hey ~ he might have been very naughty when he was a kid. He was once reprimanded at some time?

## Briefly describe the timeline, the approximate process, so I will remember later:
It took him almost two hours to check the air tickets, check the various bookings on the route
At this moment I was still asleep.
After I woke up, we two started to book tickets. He had tried to book a few times before but was unsuccessful.

Then we started booking tickets many times, always the last step was unsuccessful,
And every time we make a reservation, we can't choose pervious seat which we booked before, they are still occupying.

The entire booking process is always the same.

At this moment he exploded, very angry. Start to be emotional,
This is not the first time and not to mention many other similar incidents.

He may not think so, but I have seen it quite often.

The difference this time is that I no longer react to his various emotions.

Just continue to use my own way-try different ways to solve a problem-to face the current situation
He went downstairs to smoke, and I searched for keywords to ask this question, and found that this happened on many people and many answers.

## The solution is
1. Use a different browser
2.  Expedia - agency website to book

I did it again by using the 1 method and failed. He came back and said that lets try to use another browser , it  failed again. Finally, we booked successfully by Expedia.

Small tips:
**Notice how I made some duplicates of the booking info to simple copy and paste**
This small method is usually paying attention to **how to adjust the tool to help the operation faster**

## There are two main points in this matter
1. Emotional: nervous, upset, reluctant, angry, **unable to accept things that don't get the desired result the way they want**
2. The **way** to deal with things: repeat the same problem and stay deadlocked in it and refuse to let go and see other ways
These two points were put together and the backlog piled up, causing the final outbreak. And it is a vicious circle. The more you repeat, the more you worry, the more you fail, the more you get angry. Finally, you slam the door and go downstairs.

So it ’s okay to face these things in a reasonable way.
1. Emotionally stable, I believe my inner-self +my higher self are always on my side, helping me on everything. Focusing on results and **letting go** must deal with things the same way. Let go of what you must do. lay down.
Pay attention to the results you want. It is not necessary to buy a ticket from an official website to have the effect of official website booking. Even if Expedia is not the official website, since online people say it is successful, try it, maybe it has the same reservation mechanism on the official website. **Pay more attention to different ways! **Pay attention to your **core needs** and the effect of booking on the official website may not necessarily be obtained from the official website.

It's not that I'm very powerful, but I'm often used to it. It is customary to remember to switch methods at any time. Pay attention to your core needs. I also have my own problem. That is super fast to change the runway. Once something doesn't work out, I won't stick to it. Will feel time wasted. It can even be said to change the method as soon as possible, and even change the results.
Another point is that I learned it very early, and I was not happy to express this feeling of dissatisfaction with the result of one thing, and it was not useful. Be patient.

The above two points can be learned and changed! !! !!** Pay attention to your emotions, those situations that require smoking. Pay attention to the changes you want to pursue instead of staying the same. **What remains unchanged is dead. What changes is alive.

## Also! !! !! Other deeper connotations --- release

When I remind this emotional point, said we will talk about tomorrow. He thundered
When I state that this is just a note, not a condemnation, it does not mean that you did something wrong. As I said before, it seems that the fear of the child being reprimanded suddenly dropped.

This emotional change made me think that in a certain period he went from being a mischievous child to a quiet and sensible "adult". He also experienced a period of "reprimand" and "education" during this period. He may have been reprimanded by serious parents. This led to the inner children still having such worries and fears. Fear of being reprimanded if they failed to do well The harm is still hidden inside. This little child has always used this method (as the highlights above), originally to protect himself from being harmed at the stage of reprimand, and insisted on doing something (possibly If you do n’t do well, you will be blamed.) This part is still functioning and protecting yourself from being harmed, and the past damage is no longer, but this part is not known yet. It is allowed to use the updated method to face the challenge of updating.

One of the ways you can do this is to invite the child to communicate well in meditation, and bring it into the light, into the higher state, and take it the top of the mountain and look at the mountain together.

The core point is to carefully put down and release this part, so that the part that was fixed in the past and cannot be released can be updated to a better one.

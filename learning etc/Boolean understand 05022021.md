Why true why false?
Why 0 is false?

## Think as if it is valuable .


```
let example1 = false;
let example2 = true;
let example3 = null;
let example4 = undefined;
let example5 = '';
let example6 = NaN;
let example7 = -5;
let example8 = 0;)
```



like

0 doesn’t value any, so 0 is false,
"" has nothing inside,(no value) that is why is is false.
"  " with space, it  has something inside, and is a string, has value, so it is true.

NaN not a number, doesn’t value any.
-5 is value of -5. so it is valuable.

At the beginning I was always use false as wrong, but it is mainly just by value, has value? or doesn’t value any.

That's my understanding ...
Hope this can help you as well.

# “Creating self-esteem and self-worth involves honoring your own feelings and path and direction. It means honoring yourself with your words, actions, and behavior.”


“How you treat yourself is
how others will treat you.”


“If you do find yourself around those kinds of people, act with dignity and remember that they are not respecting you because they do not respect themselves. You can telepathically send out a message about how you want to be treated. Others only take advantage of you and take you for granted if you let them.”


“They most likely cannot recognize their own greater selves, and so it is not possible for them to honor yours”


“No matter how good you feel about yourself, there will always be those who do not treat you in a respectful way, for they have not learned how to treat themselves in a loving way”


“The relationships you have with others can only be as good as the relationships they have with themselves. If they do not know how to love themselves, that limits how much they can love you. No matter how hard you try, how many nice things you do, they cannot give you the love you seek. Forgiveness is the key to feeling good about how others treat you. Then, release any anger you may feel, simply let it go and focus on other things.”


“Every situation in your life
is a learning experience
created by your soul
to teach you how to gain
more love and power.”


“When someone does something you do not like, open your heart before you speak. If you choose to make a statement, state what you feel about the situation, rather than blame someone for something they did to you. You can say, “I feel hurt,” rather than, “You hurt me.” A powerful way to state this is, “I am choosing to feel hurt,” for every feeling you have is one you have chosen”


“You cannot leave a situation until you have done so with love. Those situations you leave in anger will be there for you to resolve in the future. It may not be with the same person, but you will create a similar situation with another person that allows you to resolve it with peace and love.”


“It is easy to respect yourself when others respect you. The challenge is to respect yourself when those around you do not. First, forgive them, and then let go of any need for them to validate you. When you need other people to validate, appreciate, or understand you to feel good about yourself, you give away your power.”

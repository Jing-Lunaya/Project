# “Love: Knowing the
Wisdom of the Heart

 
Love is the food of the Universe. It is the most important ingredient in life. Children go toward love; they thrive on love and grow on love, and they would die without it. Love is an energy that circles the world; it exists everywhere and in everything.”

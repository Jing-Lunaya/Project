What brings joy into your life? Do you know? Are you aware of that which makes you happy? Are you so busy fulfilling your daily obligations that you put off to some future time those things that make you feel good? The path of joy deals with present and not future time. Are you holding an image of what life will be like one day when you are happy, but not feeling that sense of well-being right now, today?

The past can assist you if you remember the times in which you succeeded, creating positive memories. The future can be your friend if you see that in picturing it you are creating a vision of the next step. Do not make yourself wrong because you have not yet achieved your vision. It is important to love who you are now without reservation.

Freedom is an inner feeling. It is the ability to choose what you want. It is the knowledge that you are the captain of the ship. Freedom is knowing that you own your own life, that you are the one in charge. Freedom is essential for joy, for anywhere you feel trapped or that someone has taken away your rights, you cannot experience joy.

Freedom is important if you are to bring the light of your soul into your consciousness. You live on a planet of free will, where you learn about action and reaction, cause and effect. Earth reality is based on choice. No matter what situation you are experiencing in your life, whether you think you have freedom or not, you have made a choice to be in that situation, whether or not you were aware of making that choice.

You learn by trial and error. Do not make yourself or others wrong for the choices they are making, for everyone is always growing through the outcomes and results of their actions. In this earth school of free will you call life there are many lessons and challenges of freedom.

Freedom is something you create for yourself. Freedom is not given to you, and it cannot be taken away. You can choose to give it away, and you can choose not to claim it, but others cannot take it. Only you can give it away. There are many areas of freedom in your life you know nobody would be able to take away from you. Perhaps you have a favorite place to eat and you feel free to eat there. You know deep inside that no one would be able to stop you.

You cannot own another person, nor can you have a relationship of equality when you are taking freedom away from someone else. All people have the right to do what is enlivening and growth-oriented for them.

Ironically, the more freedom you give people, the more they will want to be with you.

Do you demand things of others that you would not want them to demand of you? Do you expect them to report in to you, live up to your pictures, and be there whenever you want? Whatever degree of freedom you take from others is the degree of freedom you take from yourself.

Imagine a prisoner sitting in a cell with a guard who must guard him twenty-four hours a day. The question is, who is really the prisoner? If you feel that you must watch over or guard others all the time, that you cannot trust them or give them freedom, you are just as trapped as they are. Many of you lose your freedom because you are so closely guarding those things that you do not want taken away from you.

Joy is an inner note that you sound as you move through the day.

Being open to accept new things, ideas, and people into your life creates an ever-expanding capacity for joy. There is a mass thought form that the future might be worse than the present. This creates the need to hang on to what you have, freeze things as they are, and keep them from changing. Doing this can lead to much pain.

Embracing the new means being open to having more in your life. Many of you think that what you have created up until now is the best you can do. You make something and think that the first try is your best. However, on the second and third tries you may do even better.

As you create things in your life, you become better and more skilled. That is the process of life. A child who first begins walking is wobbly and unsteady. As the child practices, he or she becomes strong and steady in his or her stride. It is the same with everything you do, for life is like a spiral in which you circle around again and again, often to the same issues, but each time from a higher perspective.

Opening to new things means trusting and having faith in yourself and others. It means believing that the future holds joy and promise. It means believing in your growth and direction. The heart is the center of faith, trust, and belief. Opening to the new means opening your heart. Be willing to step outside of your normal limits and viewpoints and see the world in different ways. Trust that the world is safe and know that you are the director and the producer of what occurs in your life.

Be open to surprises and new things. Keep your heart open. Some of you experience a feeling of vulnerability or fear when you think of bringing new people or new things into your lives. What you call tension or anxiety before an event can be viewed instead as focusing your energy to prepare you for something new. This change in your vibration prepares you for something that is finer and higher in your life. You may feel that you must first conquer fear and anxiety before you step out and accomplish something. Everyone has that inner feeling of tension to some degree before attempting new things; it is a period of gathering energy to make the shift into a higher vibration.

Everything that happens to you assists you in bringing yourself to a higher level of evolution. Even those things you call negative or bad occur to show you new ways of responding so that you may be more balanced, peaceful, and joyful in the future. If it looks like the same problem or situation is occurring over and over, be aware that every single time it happens in a new way.

An attitude of openness and receptivity will draw to you many good things. Let go of the fear that the future may mean having less than you have now or may take something away from you. Open up to the idea that you will be wiser, stronger, and more powerful tomorrow and that whatever you create will be even better than what you already have. Be open to new concepts and words. They are often the way the Universe brings you the signs and guideposts of your next step.

Loving yourself means accepting yourself as you are right now.

Loving yourself means stepping outside of guilt.

Your beliefs about reality create your experience of it.

Last but not least, do not take yourself so seriously.

How you treat yourself is how others will treat you.

Every situation in your life is a learning experience created by your soul to teach you how to gain more love and power.

Self-worth is knowing that you are choosing your feelings at every moment.

Whatever you pay attention to is what you create.

The images you send out about yourself into the world determine how other people see you.

I recognize the light within me and humbly acknowledge my nobility.
I express power with love and wisdom.
I have much to offer the world.
I am competent, smart, and able.
I am kind, loving, and full of light.
I recognize the many good qualities I have.
I focus on what I am doing well.
I say positive things to myself.
I surround myself with people who have my greatest good in mind.
I recognize the many good qualities others have within them.
I listen to people with an open heart and ear.
I am fully present with others when
I am with them.
I release any thoughts of what
I lack and focus instead on all that I have.
I acknowledge the beauty and light in others.
I assist others in recognizing and expressing their beauty and inner light.
I motivate, encourage, and support people in recognizing who they are.
I inspire people.

What is inner peace? All of you have a picture in your mind of what you think inner peace is. You have achieved this state many times, sometimes for moments, even for hours, and so you know what inner peace feels like. Part of growth is learning to create that feeling without being dependent upon things turning out a certain way or needing people to respond in a specific way.

You want to create inner peace as something you are and be able to give and share it with others. You become the center, radiating your soulâ€™s light outward, rather than reacting, or waiting for situations, relationships, and events in your life to be arranged in such a way that you have peace.

Creating inner peace from the higher levels is learning to open your heart. It means that you are not focused or attached on an emotional level to things that happen in the world around you. You know who you are, and you let things flow around you without touching or affecting your sense of peace. You can learn to touch and affect the energy in the outer world from that center of energy within yourself. That is peace.

Opening the heart means remaining open and loving no matter what another person does, no matter what occurs to you, or what happens in your career. It means choosing to feel peaceful no matter what your outer life looks like. It is easy to be loving and open when those around you are loving; the challenge is to be loving when those around you are closed, afraid, or negative.

Inner peace comes from within, not from without.

Anything you are attached to or must have a certain way, any belief or concept that is inflexible, will be an area in which your inner peace can be affected. The goal is to take that sense of inner peace and affect everything in the outer world, touching it with that energy. The first step is to find that sense of inner peace.

One of the simplest ways is through relaxing your body, which you can do both through physical touch and through mental relaxation. Your body can be the receptacle of many thoughts that are not peaceful. If you can bring your body to a state of peace and rest, the mind can be taught that feeling and learn to create it. Peace is more than just a feeling of relaxation in the body. It is a very specific radio wave, a vibration you send out that affects everything in your outer world.

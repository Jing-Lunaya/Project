### I know chinese looked all super serious on this virus.  they didn’t care much about it at the beginning just like anyone else, but people starts to die families by families, anyone who was sent home, happened to effected on the whole family. And the death numbers starts to rise much higher than people who was tested to be effected. The total control started at that moment, and that was why all Chinese looked so serious about it.  We see neighbors are dying.... In China people feels strange that the rest of the world didn’t pay much of an attention until now, I guess the news are not really transparent in between China to Western world. Most of the people will not really read China news, they will read their own news about this, and usually doctors would recommend people to heal themselves at any kind of the illness, which also quite different from China. This just a guess. Usually I don’t really like to talk about it so much, I don’t want to bring any political things in between friends. But I also don’t want to not say anything to hide the informations , informations that people should know about. My wish is just healthy and joy life everywhere. Wish you all the best:)
